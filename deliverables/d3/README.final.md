# Sumaria

## Description 
* Provide a high-level description of your application and it's value from an end-user's perspective
    * Our application is a website that helps volunteering organizations (non-profits) manage and broadcast their events, and help volunteers find the best event that best suits their skills as well as availabilities.
* What is the problem you're trying to solve?
    * There is currently no management system (at least not well-known) that is (solely) designed and dedicated for volunteers and volunteering activities and this is the problem we want to solve.
* Is there any context required to understand why the application solves this problem?
    * At the moment, non-profit organizations mainly use 2 different customer relationship management systems (CRM), namely Excel and Blackbaud CRM.
    * Excel requires lots of manual work, the amount of work is at least linearly scaled with the number of volunteers or applicants, which is very inefficient and time consuming. Blackbaud CRM charges a licensing fee that is hard for non-profit organizations to justify paying for and it is not oriented for managing volunteers and volunteering events.
    * The completed application will be more efficient than excel and is dedicated to manage volunteer and volunteer events.

 * How do you access it? Are accounts pre-created or does a user register? Where do you start? etc. 
 * Provide clear steps for using each feature described above
 * If you cannot deploy your application for technical reasons, please let your TA know at the beginning of the iteration. You will need to demo the application to your partner either way.
 
 Users can navigate to the web page http://35.245.128.20 to access the website.
 Through the login/signup button they can create an account by supplying the information noted above.

#### The side bar contains the following options:

 ## Development requirements
 * If a developer were to set this up on their machine or a remote server, what are the technical requirements (e.g. OS, libraries, etc.)?
 * Briefly describe instructions for setting up and running the application (think a true README).

### Prerequisite to run our app:

Install node

### Steps to run our app:
 
1. Open the command console

2. Start the backend by: 
    * navigate to the folder /team-project-sumaria/src/
    * Type in console “npm install” to install dependencies
    * Type in console “node app.js” 
    * Console should return “Listening on port ####”

3. Start the frontend by:
    * Open a new console
    * Navigate to the folder /team-project-sumaria/src/public
    * Type in console “npm install” to install dependencies
    * Type in console “npm start”
    * Our website should open on your internet browser.

### Technical requirements:
* As noted above the libraries would be installed using npm install, there are no OS requirements.

 ## Licenses 

 Keep this section as brief as possible. You may read this [Github article](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository) for a start.

 * What type of license will you apply to your codebase?
 * What affect does it have on the development and use of your codebase?
 * Why did you or your partner make this choice?

* We decided to apply an MIT License to the codebase.
  * It is a permissive software license which means that:
    * Other developpers or users are free to relicense the codebase under another name
    * It can be used with other codebases that may have more restrictive licenses (Ones that are proprietary or permissive as well).
    * The only requirement being that a copy of the license terms be included with with the codebase.
  * We felt that this licence was was appropriate, since currently the project is only an MVP, and our partner has plans for it to continue to develop and grow. This means that it may be integrated with other codebases, and be modified which is what the license allows for. Furthermore our partner would like this project be used for commercial purposes, which the license also permits.
