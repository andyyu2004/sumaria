# Sumaria

## Iteration 03

 * Start date: November 23, 2019
 * End date: December 1, 2019

### Changes from you `product.md`

List the most significant changes you made to your product (if any). It's normal to change features mid-project or reduce the scope to meet timelines. 
 
 * We reduced the scope of User Story 3: "As a volunteer organizer, I would like to be able to add volunteers via an Excel document so I can send out invites faster."
At the current moment, a volunteer organizer is able to import a CSV or XLSX file and see all the information within the spreadsheet. But we have not implemented the functionality that pulls selected volunteer's emails from the imported file and sends out invitations to those volunteers.

We are making this change in order to meet the timeline of deliverable 3. As a group, we decided that other features were more important and we prioritizes those instead.

 * During our initial meeting for D3 with our partner, it was decided that instead of being able to upload files within group chats, files would be uploaded to an event page instead.

This design change was also made due to time constraints, since file handling with the chat would be much more complex to implement. At this current moment, users now would have to link to an event page to refer to a given document in a chat.

   
### Handoff plan

Describe your plan for handing off your product and all technical assets to your partner

 * Will you have a handoff meeting? If so, what will be discussed?
 We will have a handoff meeting after our final demo in class. We will discuss all the assets associated with our product and also how our partner can access them in the future.
 * What assets/artifacts will you be handing off to your partner (e.g. codebase, deployment tools, running application, task tracker, etc.)? 
 We will be handing off our codebase (on a Github Repository) and a google cloud account associated with hosting the Sumaria website.
 * How will you hand off these assets/artifacts?
 We will give our partner a document that includes detailed instruction on how to utilize the assets associated with our product. Furthermore, the document will include all account credentials he will need to continue the development of our product.
 * Does your partner have the technical capacity to manage/maintain/develop your product? How will that impact how you handoff the product?

Our partner Odane does not have the technical capacity to manage/maintain/develop our product but he has a plan in place to continue the development of our product.  He has a significant number of perspective users that are interested in our product.  After getting the aforementioned users on board on our product, Odane plans to pitch our product to investors.  After getting funding from investors, our partner will hire technical people to develop our product further.

This impacts how we will handoff our product by:
 * We need to write more detailed instructions on how to utilize the assets/artifacts associated with our product.
 * We must use layman terms where possible so that our partner can more easily use our product.
