## Iteration 03

 * Start date: November 23, 2019
 * End date: December 1, 2019

### Changes from you `product.md`

List the most significant changes you made to your product (if any). It's normal to change features mid-project or reduce the scope to meet timelines. 

 * Start with the most significant change
 * Identify either a change in features or a reduction of your original scope
 * For each change, explain why you are making it and what you are hoping to achieve from it

 > *Note:* If you are not making (or haven't made) any changes to your product, it means you successfully scoped, planned and executed the development of your application.This is a very rare occurrence - describe what you believed enabled your team to do so and why. 
 
 * We reduced the scope of User Story 3: "As a volunteer organizer, I would like to be able to add volunteers via an Excel document so I can send out invites faster."
   * At the current moment, a volunteer organizer is able to import a CSV or XLSX file and see all the information within the spreadsheet. But we have not implemented the functionality that pulls selected volunteer's emails from the imported file and sends out invitations to those volunteers.
   
### Handoff plan

Describe your plan for handing off your product and all technical assets to your partner

 * Will you have a handoff meeting? If so, what will be discussed?
 * What assets/artifacts will you be handing off to your partner (e.g. codebase, deployment tools, running application, task tracker, etc.)? 
 * How will you hand off these assets/artifacts?
 * Does your partner have the technical capacity to manage/maintain/develop your product? How will that impact how you handoff the product?


> *Note:* This is one of the most important aspects of the project. Please consult with your partner, your TA and the instructors on how to successfully execute this.
