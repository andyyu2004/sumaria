# Sumaria

## Iteration 1 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 11, 2019
 * Where: Bahen Centre for Information Technology

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Split into a front-end and back-end team
  * the teams were able to do their work fairly independently of each other with little fuss

* Use MongoDB
  * At first, we were apprehensive about using a non-relational database because 6/7 team members had no experience with them.
  * But 1 team member had extensive experience with MongoDB and he explained how MongoDB would work with our application successfully.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Scrum methodology
  * Was not successful because as a group of 7 (later became 6) we found it hard to meet up frequently and plan project tasks every sprint cycle (weekly)


#### Planned changes

* Change software development process from Scrum to Kanban
  * Gives more flexibility
  * Continuous flow instead of segmented sprints
* Better use of trello task board
  * To help with task organization and assignments

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Login & sign up
* Event creation and browsing
* Chat system
* Forgotten password page
* Link to task board:
  * https://trello.com/b/xXJaCXI7/sumaria

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* Profiles: Didn’t get around to it yet though there’s been a start.

#### How was your product demo?

* How did you prepare your demo?
  * We decided together what features we were ready to show him and went through the pages of the website one last time to make sure they worked correctly.
  
* What did you manage to demo to your partner?
  * We showed him how to create an event and that the newly created event could be seen on the browse page. Then we demonstrated logging in and how one could access the chat page once you were logged in. We also demonstrated how one could create a chat with any number of people and use it as either a private chat or a group chat.

* Did your partner accept the features?
  * Yes, he said it was fine. He liked the chat implementation. Better than the one described in the original plan.

* Were there change requests?
  * No, though he had some suggestions on what to work on next (schedules, excel sheet upload, etc) and some discussions on realistic ways to implement features (e.g. file sharing, geolocation, etc.)

* What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
  * Sometimes viewing the product from a marketing perspective is quite different from viewing the product from a technical perspective.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Change software development process from Scrum to Kanban
  * Gives more flexibility
  * Continuous flow instead of segmented sprints

* Finish remaining features:
  * Calender
  * Excel sheet upload
  * File sharing for events
  * Sort events by geolocation
