## Iteration 1

 * Start date: Monday, October 28, 2019
 * End date: Monday, November 11, 2019

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

We will be splitting work in three main components: front-end, back-end, and fullstack, with further divisions within each role.

**Back-end team:**

Cameron: Provide project structure. Build out business logic for the app, establish blueprint/structure for the REST API. Responsible for deployment.

Stanley: Implementing functions and methods of the back-end.

**Front-end team:**

Elaine: Creating Skeleton of pages, Design and styling

Andy: API Integration

Jackie: Creating Skeleton of pages, Meeting Note Taker.

**Fullstack:**

Isaac (Yu-Hsiang): Will help whichever team is currently most in need.

#### Team member Details

**Front End:**

Elaine: Front end with a focus on design and styling
Strength: Has previous experience with CSS and HTML. Currently learning to use Javascript. Currently learning to use React.js, and Node.js. 
Weakness: Has never used Bootstrap. Has not worked with MongoDB or non-relational databases before. Inexperienced with APIs.

Andy: Front end with a focus on the background details, such as  state management and server calls.
Strengths: Familiar with react and some experience making API calls from javascript.
Weaknesses: Design and styling. New to the agile methodology.

Jackie: Front end with a focus on API Integration
Strength: Has some experience with CSS and HTML. Has experience with Python and other object oriented languages i.e. Java.
Weakness: Has never used Bootstrap, React.js. and Node.js. Is new to the Agile Scrum development methodology.

**Back End:**

Stanley:
Strengths: Familiar with software development cycle (agile and waterfall). I have worked as a Software developer doing C# on the backend, a bit of HTML, CSS, Javascript on the front-end, and relational SQL on the database.
Weaknesses: No experience with MongoDB, NodeJS, ExpressJS.  

Cameron:
Strength: Experience working with NodeJS, MongoDB and ExpressJS. 
Weakness: No experience working with an Agile development methodology. Have never worked with a non-technical partner. No experience working with Excel-supported filetypes. 

**Full Stack:**

Isaac (Yu-Hsiang): Work on both front-end and back-end.
Strength: Isaac has working experience of (and is currently working with) both front-end UI development as well as back-end server development through agile practices. In the scope of this project, Isaac is familiar with CSS, HTML, and JS (include various libraries and frameworks) on the client side, some working knowledge with both relational database (mySQL) and document-oriented database (ES) and API design and integration (designs and documentations with swaggerAPI, integration experiences with Zendesk and CT), and have used nodeJS with PHP on the server side.
Weakness: Isaac has limited experience with top-notch modern framework (e.g. reactJS) and has not used nodeJS extensively but a different framework (Sencha EXTJS). Isaac has comparatively less knowledge on the theory and design side of these languages, more on the practical side. Besides, Isaac has little experience with systematic tests in larger scales.

##### Team's working culture

We will be employing parts of the Agile Scrum methodology.

In terms of roles as noted above, all members of the team are on the Development Team.

To keep track of tasks to be completed during sprints, as well as the high-level requirements, we are using Trello as our Sprint and Product Backlog. A link is provided below in the artifacts section.

Each sprint will be between one to two weeks. As noted below, we will meet in person during each tutorial session each week to have the Planning meetings and Review meetings of each sprint. It is during this time that we will review on a high level user stories of the Product Backlog and discuss the tasks each member needs to complete to fulfill them, which will be listed on the Trello Board. We will also go over parts finished and problems encountered in the last sprint and see if they need to be added into the new sprint as well. 

Due to the busy schedules of all team members, it is infeasible that we have daily stand up meetings face to face. Instead we will keep close communication using Facebook’s messenger between meetings, to ensure that no one is falling behind.


##### Communications:

We will meet every two weeks as the minimum. We will maintain constant communication between the partner through email and also on Trello board (which allows communication using comments). We can notify the partner on a particular task when needed (on Trello board first for quick and short response) and if required we will send the details through email. Further discussions can take place either through emails or directly on the Trello board.

##### Meetings:

We will create strict timelines for action items, and will be tracking our progress using a Trello board. In the event of a missed deadline, we will communicate via our shared group chat to see what the issue is, and provide help if necessary. In the extreme event this does not work, or someone is unreachable, we will address the issue as a group with our TA. 


##### Conflict Resolution:

1. Indecisions on the languages and frameworks for the product

Everyone propose their selections, then proceed to investigate the pros and cons of each language/framework, after that each person comes up to explain the reasons for choosing a particular one over the rest, and then we make the decision by the majority rule (vote).

2. Non-responsive team members.

We have a consensus that if one of us is not responsive, everyone else can attempt to contact that person using the methods provided beforehand (which should not be used for normal contacts and should definitely not be abused but are a more guaranteed way(s) to get in touch with the person). If none of the above works, we will come up with a detailed plan for the person and unavoidably assign certain roles for that person depending on current progress of the team.

3. If members fall behind on tasks.

This may be a sign that certain tasks were too big to be done in one sprint. In this case we should try to break down the tasks further, or re-evaluate the importance of the task trying to be completed. Otherwise, more experienced members could try to help in finishing/guiding the process.


#### Events

We will have in person meetings every week during tutorial for the sprint review and sprint planning. We will also have meetings with our partner every two weeks also in person to confirm that we are tracking with what our partner wants. Otherwise we will be keeping in touch through Facebook’s messenger if any problem arises.

Our first meeting of this iteration was during tutorial on Monday, October 28, 2019. There we decided on the user stories that we would work on and what each member would start to do.

Our second meeting of this iteration would be on Monday, November 4, 2019 at 6:10 PM. This meeting would be to review what was already done and what still needs to be done for the rest of the week. It could also be a chance to do a small code review/coding session in person for the front/back end teams.

Our third meeting of this iteration would be on Monday, November 11, 2019 at 8:00 PM (During tutorial). This meeting would be to review the work done, and what else needs to be fixed/completed before the due date, based on the partner’s wishes.

#### Artifacts

An invite link to the Trello board: https://trello.com/invite/b/xXJaCXI7/ead8360d041bc4f248ce6d312f1f1618/sumaria

We put the technical requirements in the unstarted column. Each requirement, when we start working on it, will be broken down into small sprints and will then move to the started column. We prioritize tasks based on discussions in the meeting and it is roughly ordered from highest to lowest in the unstarted column.

The tasks on the review section are for review. An obvious example is when a task is blocked.

The ones in the finished state are the ones that are comparatively independent or is finished as of the scope of the task.

We will put the cards in the delivered column when a task is complete in its finest, is reviewed, and is approved by the partner.

The general steps for creating a sprint (a manageable task):

Create a card (i.e. a sprint) with description (a more detailed explanation of what needs to be done), members (person(s) responsible for it), labels (category for the sprint), story points (estimated number of hours for the task), checklists (a list of small tasks to complete), and  comments when needed (or it might act as a starting point for discussions).

We will have weekly sprint (in the started column) with reasonable workloads.

The tasks are assigned based on the working culture and our separation of roles.

(This board can also be used by the partner to monitor and track our progress. It also provides a quick way to communicate on any particular tasks and gives confirmations whenever needed)

#### Deployment and Github Workflow

Describe your Git / GitHub workflow. Essentially, we want to understand how your team members shares a codebase, avoid conflicts and deploys the application.

 * Be concise, yet precise. For example, "we use pull-requests" is not a precise statement since it leaves too many open questions - Pull-requests from where to where? Who reviews the pull-requests? Who is responsible for merging them? etc.
 * If applicable, specify any naming conventions or standards you decide to adopt.
 * Describe your overall deployment process from writing code to viewing a live applicatioon
 * What deployment tool(s) are you using and why
 * Don't forget to **explain why** you chose this workflow or particular aspects of it!

Since we have divided the work in a way that allows each member of the team to work on a different section (i.e. front-end/back-end, different pages, different user stories) we have minimized the chance of conflicts. However if conflicts do occur between two individuals then they will use messenger or discord to discuss which changes should be kept.

Concerning naming conventions, since we are using javascript/typescript we decided to stick to javascript’s naming conventions.
* Using camel case convention.
* Methods/functions start with lowercase.
* Components start with uppercase.
* The closing brace is on the same indent as the original function call


## Product

#### Goals and tasks

1. Our first goal is to have a functioning login/sign up system, since this is at the base of all of the other user stories.
    * The back-end needs to create/design a database, and api functions for accessing/maintaining security with this data on user information.
    * The front-end needs to create the pages for login/sign up, home page, user profile. As well as integrate the api functions with the pages.

Our goals are structured around the following user stories (also listed on trello) ordered in terms of importance:

2. “As a charity event planner, I would like to be able to create events so that I can share information with participants”
3. “As a student looking for experience, I would like to be able to find volunteer opportunities so I can gain relevant skills.”
    * The back-end with the database from part 1 add api functions for accessing data relevant to events.
    * The front-end needs to create the pages for event creation and event browsing. As well as integrate the api functions with the pages.

4. “As a first time volunteer, I would like to be able to chat with the event organizers to inquire about positions and duties I would take on so I can decide if this is the event I would like to participate in.”
    * The back-end with the database from part 1 add api functions for accessing data relevant to chat messages.
    * The front-end needs to create a page for chat messaging. As well as integrate the api functions with the page.

#### Artifacts

Our main artifact will be building a webpage and uploading it so that it can be publicly accessible. This webpage will contain features outlined in the goals above:
* A page for login/sign ups.
* A page for viewing one’s profile.
* A page for creating/browsing events.
* A page for users to chat amongst themselves.

Our secondary artifact will be the trello page we would be maintaining as mentioned above. Although it is mainly a tool for organization, it would be a good tool for displaying currently working features on our project.
